/// An extension of `SIMD3<Float>` providing geometric utilities for 3D vector operations.
///
/// These methods are particularly useful for spatial reasoning in hand tracking applications,
/// such as measuring angles between joints or determining gesture directionality in a 3D space.
///
/// The functions assume right-handed coordinate system conventions, as typically used in ARKit and visionOS.

    /// of a finger or the divergence between finger directions.

    /// - Returns: The angle between `self` and `other` in degrees, ranging from 0째 to 180째.
